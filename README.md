# Escape From Earth Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theParadox42/EFE-Backend.svg?branch=auth)](https://travis-ci.org/theParadox42/EFE-Backend)

This is the backend part of [escape from earth](https://escapefromearth.tk) that handles the community section of it. Changes are currently underway. `v1` is the version in use, but is about to be deprecated. `v2` is about to be released and brings a lot of great changes including user authentication, liking, disliking, and flagging levels, plus security boosts. The versions are available at [escape-from-earth.herokuapp.com/v1 OR v2](escape-from-earth.herokuapp.com)  

A api documentation is not released, so if you feel like you want to understand it, just contact me and I can guide you from there.  

You are welcome to submit an issue or open up a pull request if you want.
